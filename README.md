# Coromon-Kaizo-Challenge
This github is our documentation for the Coromon Kaizo Challenge run!  This includes rules, updates, and any additional information related to the challenge.

## Purpose of Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to add higher difficulty to the game, while also introducing tactics and strategy in forcing players to use only a single Mon for the run.  We used the foundation of the [Pokemon Ironmon Challenge](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1) rules to craft our own rules while adapting to the game mechanics of Coromon.  This is designed to be difficult, and many runs will be lost, so tread carefully.  Only those looking for insane difficulty should try this challenge!

## Special Thanks and Contributors
Special thanks to those who created the Pokemon Ironmon challenges and rules, they were the basis of this challenge.
